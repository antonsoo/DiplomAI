# DiplomAI

**DiplomAI** is an open-source project focused on developing a real-time conflict resolution AI assistant. Built using large language models (LLMs), speech recognition, and sentiment analysis, DiplomAI aims to help individuals—especially those who struggle with verbal communication or find themselves in high-stress interactions—navigate difficult conversations effectively. Whether it’s a family argument, a heated exchange after a minor accident, or a confrontation with a bully, DiplomAI aspires to provide on-the-spot guidance to reduce tension, encourage understanding, and foster better communication.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition:**  
  Convert live audio from a video feed into text. This allows the AI to understand the conversation as it unfolds.

- **LLM-Powered Conflict Resolution:**  
  Use a large language model to analyze the situation, understand the context, and generate recommendations or direct interventions. The LLM can provide de-escalation strategies, empathetic responses, or assertive but respectful counters to unfair arguments.

- **Two Response Modes:**
  1. **Autonomous Spoken Intervention:** The AI can use text-to-speech (TTS) to speak directly into the situation, acting as an impartial mediator.
  2. **Guided User Prompts:** The AI can provide private, real-time textual suggestions to the person who needs support, helping them find the right words.

- **Emotion & Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Detect the emotional tone of participants, helping the AI choose the most appropriate, context-sensitive responses.

- **Privacy & Control:**  
  Users have full control over when to start and stop the system. The project aims for minimal data retention and ethical guidelines on data usage.

## Project Status

**DiplomAI is currently in the early stages of development.**  
The initial focus is to set up the foundational pipeline:
- Ingest audio/video from a source.
- Perform real-time speech-to-text transcription.
- Integrate a local LLM for generating conflict resolution responses.
- Produce basic text output for user guidance.

Over time, we plan to:
- Introduce sentiment and emotional analysis.
- Implement TTS for autonomous intervention.
- Enhance UI/UX components and possibly enable AR or mobile integration.
- Explore advanced strategies for different types of conflicts.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Speech Recognition:** OpenAI Whisper, Vosk, or other ASR systems
- **LLM Integration:** A local open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA 2, Mistral, Falcon) or other community-supported models
- **Vector Store (Optional):** FAISS or Chroma for maintaining conversation context
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Transformer-based sentiment/emotion classifiers (e.g., models from Hugging Face)
- **TTS (Planned):** Coqui TTS or Mozilla TTS
- **Video Processing (Planned):** OpenCV, optional advanced modules for gesture recognition

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** recommended.
- **pip** or **conda** for installing Python dependencies.
- A GPU-enabled environment (optional but recommended) for faster LLM inference.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DiplomAI.git
   cd DiplomAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   *(Note: `requirements.txt` will be updated as the project matures. For now, it may include placeholder dependencies.)*

3. **Set up ASR and LLM models:**
   - Instructions for downloading or linking to an LLM and ASR model will be provided as we integrate them.
   - For Whisper (if chosen), follow the instructions at [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).

### Running a Demo (Soon)

- A basic demo script will be provided under `src/main.py` once the initial pipeline is in place. It will:
  - Take an audio input (from a file or a live feed).
  - Convert it to text.
  - Send it to the LLM for response generation.
  - Print or log suggestions to the console.

```bash
python src/main.py --audio_input sample_conversation.wav
```

*(Functionality will evolve as we progress.)*
